# The_Simons_Game

Simon is a classic electronic game that was introduced in 1978. It consists of a series of lights that flash in a specific pattern, and players must repeat the pattern by pressing the corresponding buttons. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the pattern becomes longer and more complex. Simon is a great game for improving memory, concentration, and hand-eye coordination. It is suitable for players of all ages and can be enjoyed as a solo or group activity. The game has undergone several updates and redesigns over the years, and it remains a popular choice for both casual and competitive players.
